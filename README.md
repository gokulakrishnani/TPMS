Implementation of Tire Pressure Monitoring System in Two-Wheelers for enhanced Vehicle Safety

Abstract: Tire Pressure Monitoring System is a device used to measure tire pressure. This device has become a critical tool in the automotive industry for safety, fuel efficiency, and reduced carbon emissions. This project offers a new TPMS solution for two-wheelers. This TPM system for two-wheelers takes into account the distinct challenges and requirements of motorcycles and scooters. The system design features advanced sensors, wireless communication, and real-time monitoring of the tire pressure. A warning is issued when the tire is under-inflated or over-inflated. Implementing TPMS in our vehicles helps us prevent road accidents and improve the tire life span of the tire.
